1. What is an object?
1. An instance of a class.

IF Statements


1. What is a code block?

   a.  A .NET Class Library.

   b.  Lines of code that should be treated as a single unit.

       Correct! A code block is defined by curly braces { }. It collects lines of code that should be treated as a single unit.

    c. A block of code that is blocked from being accessed.

2. What is a Boolean statement or expression?

   a.  A modulus expression.

   b.  An ordinal term.

   c.  Code that returns either true or false.

    Correct! A Boolean expression is any code that returns a Boolean value, either true or false.


3. Given that int x = 5, which of the following Boolean expressions is valid and evaluates to true?

    a. x < 5.

    b. x > 5.

    c. x == 5.

    Correct! Since x is equal to 5, using the C# equality operator == in the expression evaluates to true.

4. Which of the choices below is not a valid operator in C#?

    a. %%.

    Correct! The double percentage-sign symbol %% isn't a valid C# operator.

    b. &&.

    c. ||.

3. The following answer choices describe if statement syntax. Which of the descriptions is correct?

    a. The Boolean expression evaluated by an if statement is optional.

    b. An else statement can't be placed before an else if statement.

      Correct! An else can't be placed before an else if statement.

    c. The else statement is required when an if statement includes an else if.

ARRAYS


1. What is an array?

    1. A string variable.

    2. A sequence of individual data elements accessible through a single variable name.

       Correct. An array data structure with a single name and multiple data locations.

    3. A .NET Class Library.

2. Which of these is a correct example of creating an array and initializing it?

    1. string[] myarray = new string[3]; myarray = "test1"; myarray = "test2"; myarray = "test3";.

    2. string[] myarray = string[3]; myarray[0] = test1; myarray[1] = test2; myarray[2] = test3;.

    3. int[] myarray = new int[3]; myarray[0] = 1; myarray[1] = 2; myarray[2] = 3;.

       Correct! The array myarray is declared correctly and the code statements used to assign values to the array elements specify the array index locations.

FOREACH


1. Which of the following can be used to access the third element in an array?

    1. myArray[3].

    2. myArray[2].

    Correct! Indexes are zero-based, so an index of two returns the third element in an array.

    3. myArray{3}.

2. Which of the following choices describes the correct way to create a new integer array with three elements?

    1. int[] myArray = new int[3];.

    Correct! This is the correct way to create an array with three elements.

    2. int[] myArray = new int[2];.

    3. int myArray = new int[3];.

3. Which of the following foreach statements is syntactically correct?

    1. foreach (int value in values).

    Correct! This foreach statement is defined using valid syntax.

    2. foreach (int value of values).

    3. foreach (int value with values).

VARIABLE NAMES


1. Which of the following is an example of correct camel case formatting of a variable name?

1. UserOption.

2. user Option.

3. userOption.

Correct! This is the correct way to use camel case for a variable.

WHITESPACES


1. Which of the following demonstrates recommended guidelines for naming a variable?

    1. my-string.

    2. initialMessage$.

    3. initialMessage.

    Correct! This is the appropriate camel case for a variable name and the name is descriptive.

2. Which of the following is a bad reason to use a code comment?

    1. To describe the high-level intent of the code.

    2. To explain how a new C# keyword works.

C   orrect! Comments should not be used for this reason.

    3. To temporarily comment out a line of code while evaluating a feature in a different way.

3. Which of the following statements about using whitespace in code is true?

    1. Reducing the amount of whitespace will improve code performance (execution speed).

    2. Whitespace should be used every two or three lines to separate code lines.

    3. Whitespace should be used judiciously to improve the readability of your code.

        Correct! Whitespace should be used to improve core readability.
