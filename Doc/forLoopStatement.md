In this module, you will:

   1. Use a for statement to loop through a block of code.
   2. Examine the for statement syntax that enables you to control the iteration pattern.


Recap
****
Here are a few of the takeaways from this unit:

   1. The for iteration statement allows you to iterate through a block of code a specific number of times.
   2. The for iteration statement allows you to control every aspect of the iteration's mechanics by altering the three conditions inside the parenthesis: the initializer, condition, and iterator.
   3. It's common to use the for statement when you need to control how you want to iterate through each item in an array.
   4. If your code block has only one line of code, you can eliminate the curly braces and white space if you wish.

Summary

    2 minutes

Your goal was to gain additional control over the iteration process by implementing the for statement in your code.

Modifying the initializer, condition, and iterator of a for statement provides precise control over the iteration logic.

Using the for statement, you iterated a hard-coded number of times, and used the Length on an array to iterate through the code block once for each item in the array. You modified the iterator, the condition for exiting the loop, and the pattern for iteration. You used the break keyword to exit out of the loop's body prematurely.

Without the iteration control provided by the for statement, you wouldn't be able to complete certain coding tasks, such as looping through the data in a multidimensional array.
