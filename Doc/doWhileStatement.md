Learning objectives
****
After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

   1. Write code that uses the do-while statement to iterate through a code block
   2. Write code that uses the while statement to iterate through a code block
   3. Use the continue statement to step directly to the Boolean evaluation

Recap
****
There's a few important ideas you should take away from this unit:

   1. The do-while statement iterates through a code block at least once, and might continue to iterate based on a Boolean expression. The evaluation of the Boolean expression usually depends on some value generated or retrieved inside of the code block.
   2. The while statement evaluates a Boolean expression first, and continues to iterate through the code block as long as the Boolean expression evaluates to true.
   3. The continue keyword to step immediately to the Boolean expression.
