Learning objectives
*****
In this module, you will:

   1. Use operators to create Boolean expressions that test for comparison and equality.
   2. Use built-in methods of the string class to perform better evaluations on strings.
   3. Use the negation operator to test for the opposite of a given condition.
   4. Use the conditional operator to perform an inline evaluation.

Boolean Expression Recap
***
Here's the main takeaways you learned about evaluating Boolean expressions so far:

   1. There are many different kinds of expressions that evaluate to either true or false.
   2. Evaluate equality using the == operator.
   3. Evaluating equality of strings requires you to consider the possibility that the strings have different case and leading or trailing spaces. Depending on your situation, use the ToLower() or ToUpper() helper methods, and the Trim() helper method to improve the likelihood that two strings are equal.
   4. Evaluate inequality using the != operator.
   5. Evaluate greater than, less than and similar operations using comparison operators like >, <, >=, and <=.
   6. If a method returns a bool, it can be used as a Boolean expression.
   7. Use the logical negation operator ! to evaluate the opposite of a given expression.

Conditional Operator Recap
****
You should remember the following facts about the conditional operator:

   1.  You can use the conditional operator to reduce the size of your code, but you should ensure that the resulting code is easily readable.
   2.  You can use the conditional operator when you need to return a value that's based on a binary condition. Your code will return the first option when the condition evaluates to true, and it will return the second option when the condition evaluates to false.
