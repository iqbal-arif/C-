Learning objectives
****
In this module, you will:

   1.  Use the switch-case construct to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes.
   2.  Convert code that uses an if-elseif-else construct into a switch-case construct.

Recap
***
Here's the main takeaways you learned about the switch statement:

   1. Use the switch statement when you have one value with many possible matches, each match requiring a branch in your code logic.
   2. A single switch section containing code logic can be matched using one or more labels defined by the case keyword.
   3. Use the optional default keyword to create a label and a switch section that will be used when no other case labels match.
