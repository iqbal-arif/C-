Variable Convention Recap

The main takeaways from this exercise:

   1.  Use code comments to leave meaningful notes to yourself about the problem your code solves.
   2.  Don't use code comments that explain how C# or the .NET Class Library works.
   3.  Use code comments when temporarily trying alternative solutions until you're ready to commit to the new code solution, at which point you can delete the old code.
   4.  Never trust comments. They may not reflect the current state of the code after many changes and updates.

WhiteSpace Recap

The main takeaways from this exercise:

   1.  Use whitespace judiciously to improve the readability of your code.
   2.  Use line feeds to create empty lines to separate phrases of code. A phrase includes lines of code that are similar, or work together.
   3.  Use line feeds to separate code block symbols so that they are on their own line of code.
   4.  Use the tab key to line up a code block with the keyword they're associated with.
   5.  Indent code inside of a code block to show ownership.
