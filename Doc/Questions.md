IF Statements


1. What is a code block?

   a.  A .NET Class Library.

   b.  Lines of code that should be treated as a single unit.

       Correct! A code block is defined by curly braces { }. It collects lines of code that should be treated as a single unit.

    c. A block of code that is blocked from being accessed.

2. What is a Boolean statement or expression?

   a.  A modulus expression.

   b.  An ordinal term.

   c.  Code that returns either true or false.

    Correct! A Boolean expression is any code that returns a Boolean value, either true or false.


3. Given that int x = 5, which of the following Boolean expressions is valid and evaluates to true?

    a. x < 5.

    b. x > 5.

    c. x == 5.

    Correct! Since x is equal to 5, using the C# equality operator == in the expression evaluates to true.

4. Which of the choices below is not a valid operator in C#?

    a. %%.

    Correct! The double percentage-sign symbol %% isn't a valid C# operator.

    b. &&.

    2. A sequence of individual data elements accessible through a single variable name.

       Correct. An array data structure with a single name and multiple data locations.

    3. A .NET Class Library.

2. Which of these is a correct example of creating an array and initializing it?

    1. string[] myarray = new string[3]; myarray = "test1"; myarray = "test2"; myarray = "test3";.

    2. string[] myarray = string[3]; myarray[0] = test1; myarray[1] = test2; myarray[2] = test3;.

    3. int[] myarray = new int[3]; myarray[0] = 1; myarray[1] = 2; myarray[2] = 3;.

       Correct! The array myarray is declared correctly and the code statements used to assign values to the array elements specify the array index locations.
