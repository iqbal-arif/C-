In this module, you will:

   1. Use a for statement to loop through a block of code.
   2. Examine the for statement syntax that enables you to control the iteration pattern.


Recap
****
Here are a few of the takeaways from this unit:

   1. The for iteration statement allows you to iterate through a block of code a specific number of times.
   2. The for iteration statement allows you to control every aspect of the iteration's mechanics by altering the three conditions inside the parenthesis: the initializer, condition, and iterator.
   3. It's common to use the for statement when you need to control how you want to iterate through each item in an array.
   4. If your code block has only one line of code, you can eliminate the curly braces and white space if you wish.
