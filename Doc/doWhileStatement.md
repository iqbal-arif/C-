Learning objectives
****
After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

   1. Write code that uses the do-while statement to iterate through a code block
   2. Write code that uses the while statement to iterate through a code block
   3. Use the continue statement to step directly to the Boolean evaluation

Recap
****
There's a few important ideas you should take away from this unit:

   1. The do-while statement iterates through a code block at least once, and might continue to iterate based on a Boolean expression. The evaluation of the Boolean expression usually depends on some value generated or retrieved inside of the code block.
   2. The while statement evaluates a Boolean expression first, and continues to iterate through the code block as long as the Boolean expression evaluates to true.
   3. The continue keyword to step immediately to the Boolean expression.

Summary
******
Your goal was to use the do-while and while statements to perform iterations. The do-while and while statements are unique because the body of the code block determines whether the flow of execution should continue or stop.

Using the do-while statement, you executed a block of code once before evaluating a Boolean expression and potentially exiting the iteration. Using the while statement, you performed the evaluation of the Boolean expression immediately, and continued to evaluate it to exit the iteration. You used the continue statement within the code block to step directly to the Boolean expression.

You developed a practical application that uses the do-while and continue statements to simulate a battle in a role playing game. Real-world scenarios involving the do-while and while iteration statements involve working with streams of data from files, from the internet, or any other scenario where you'll continue to perform an iteration until a condition is met.

Without do-while and while iteration statements, it would be difficult to write and maintain iteration code that sets the exit condition within the iteration code block.
