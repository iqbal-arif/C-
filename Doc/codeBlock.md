Recap
****
Here are a few important things to remember about code blocks:

   1. When you define a variable inside of a code block, its visibility is local to that code block and inaccessible outside of that code block.
   2. To make a variable visible inside and outside of a code block, you must define the variable outside of the code block.
   3. Don't forget to initialize any variables whose value is set in a code block, such as an if statement.
