Array Recap
*******
Here's the most important things to remember when working with arrays:

   1.  An array is a special variable that holds a sequence of related data elements.
   2.  You should memorize the basic format of an array variable declaration.
   3.  Access each element of an array to set or get its values using a zero-based index   inside of square brackets.
   4. If you attempt to access an index outside of the boundary of the array, you get a run time exception.
   5. The Length property gives you a programmatic way to determine the number of elements in an array.
